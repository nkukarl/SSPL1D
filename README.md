Steady state photoluminescence in one dimension
======

This code calculates the steady state PL spectra for silicon wafers,
characterised by a injection level dependent bulk lifetime and two
injection level dependent surface recombination velocities.
It is based on a one-dimensional model and firstly calculates the 
steady state excess minority carrier density as a function
of depth into silicon and then the raw PL spectra.
PL spectra measured by a Silicon detector and a InGaAs detector are also
calculated.

Download the SSPL1D.zip file and unzip it.
Open SSPL1D.m and follow the instructions.

N.B. You need to get MATLAB installed.
The codes are programmed using MATLAB R2013b, but should be compatible with
R2012a and after.
