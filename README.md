Steady state photoluminescence in one dimension

% This code calculates the steady state PL spectra for silicon wafers,
% characterised by a injection level dependent bulk lifetime and two
% injection level dependent surface recombination velocities
% It is based on a one-dimensional model and firstly calculates the 
% steady state excess minority carrier density as a function
% of depth into silicon and then the raw PL spectra
% PL spectra measured by a Silicon detector and a InGaAs detector are also
% calculated
